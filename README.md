TrickPose AI

Full-Body 3D Movement Reconstruction from Hip-Mounted Phone Sensors

⸻

Description

TrickPose AI is an AI system that reconstructs full-body 3D movements based on gyroscope and accelerometer data from a smartphone attached to the right hip, combined with the user’s stated trick name.
This project is part of a larger application called Cliff.

The system is divided into three phases:
	•	Phase 1: Data Labeling Tool
Import a 3D human model, move the hip based on sensor data, manually adjust other body parts if needed, and label the performed trick.
	•	Phase 2: AI Training with Reward System
Train a deep neural network (DNN) that predicts full-body movements based on the phone’s sensor data and trick labels, using a custom reward mechanism.
	•	Phase 3: User Application and Interface
Create a user-friendly interface where users can upload new sensor data, specify a trick, and visualize the reconstructed full-body animation.

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TrickPose-AI.git


	2.	Navigate into the project folder:

cd TrickPose-AI


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



⸻

Technologies Used
	•	Python 3.10+
	•	TensorFlow or PyTorch (for DNN)
	•	Blender / pyglet / OpenGL (for 3D model visualization)
	•	tkinter / PyQt (for user interface)
	•	numpy, pandas, json (for data handling)

⸻

How It Works
	1.	Collect Data: Record gyroscope and accelerometer data from a phone mounted on the right hip.
	2.	Label Data: Move a 3D model’s hip based on sensor data, adjust body parts manually if needed, and label the trick.
	3.	Train AI: Train a DNN to predict body motion given sensor input and trick name, rewarding predictions that closely match labeled data.
	4.	Predict & Visualize: Upload new sensor data into the UI, select the performed trick, and view a 3D animation of the predicted movement.

Current Status
	•	Phase 1: In Progress
	•	Phase 2: Not started
	•	Phase 3: Not started

⸻

Future Plans
	•	Improve hip-to-body motion prediction with transformer models.
	•	Expand training to multiple sensor locations (optionally).
	•	Integrate mobile app version for real-time trick detection.
	•	Add auto-synchronization with GoPro video footage.
